# Influencer Performance System

A resource-intensive project designed to process video data, cluster influencers, and generate performance insights, using OpenAI's CLIP model for embeddings, facial recognition, and clustering techniques.

---

## **Architecture Overview**

1. **Input:**
   - Video URLs provided as raw data.

2. **Process Flow:**
   - Generate vector embeddings for each video using OpenAI CLIP.
   - Cluster videos based on their embeddings to identify unique videos.
   - Calculate the average performance score for each unique video.
   - Extract human faces from the videos using OpenCV Haar cascades.
   - Identify the best-captured face from extracted images.
   - Save images to a GitHub raw content repository.
   - Match influencer faces across clusters to combine clusters based on face similarity using OpenAI CLIP.
   - Calculate the average performance score for each unique influencer.

3. **Output:**
   - Generate a comprehensive report showcasing influencersâ€™ performance with clustered data, visualizations, and insights.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Accessible via a Streamlit app or as an HTML file.

## **Future Scope**
- **Real-time Face Matching:** Optimize the workflow by introducing real-time face extraction and matching, eliminating redundant processes to save resources and reduce execution time.
- **Enhanced Clustering:** Improve clustering mechanisms for better influencer detection and performance accuracy.
- **Scalability:** Adapt the system to process larger datasets more efficiently.

---

## **Challenges Faced**
- **Resource-Intensive Processing:** Managing vector generation, face matching, and clustering on non-GPU systems.
- **Data Cleaning:** Ensuring unique identification of videos and influencers from raw, unstructured data.
- **Cluster Matching:** Efficiently combining clusters to avoid duplicates while maintaining accuracy.
